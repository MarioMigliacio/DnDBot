# DnDBot
With the use of my DnD class library I have already (mostly) finished, I want to become familiar with Microsoft's BOT framework.

The goal of this project is to have a friendly service provided by a bot to aid in the creation process of a DND Hero.
This will be similar to the process that was accomplished using WINFORMs only, an entity will be walking us through the process.
